Local > Dev > Staging > Production

=====LOCAL=====
Each developer will have their own local copy which originates from the dev branch. Local
copies will be used on the developer's own machines with the local server.


=====DEV=====
Dev is something that isn't hosted anywhere, but it is used as a central repository
for developers. When they finish some work, they publish into the dev branch so that
the other teammembers can merge.


=====STAGING=====
Staging is hosted on Heroku. Read the docs about Heroku because there is much to learn.


=====PRODUCTION=====
Production is also on Heroku, through a different app than staging.
